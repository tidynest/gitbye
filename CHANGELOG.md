# Changelog

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Connection strings that name no host, such as `postgresql:///goodbye`, now
  fall back to the local socket. `psql` applies that fallback in libpq, but the
  driver does not, and refused with "both host and hostaddr are missing". The
  short form is the natural one to write, so it is now honoured.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Comparison of followers against following, sorted into four buckets: not
  following back, keeping, mutuals, and fans
- Bulk unfollow with a confirmation dialogue listing every selected account
- Bulk follow back from the fans tab
- Keep-list persisted in PostgreSQL, keyed on the immutable GitHub account id so
  protection survives an account rename
- Reversal of any keep-list decision from the keeping tab
- Sync history recorded on every run, so follow-graph trends can be reported later
- Token borrowed from the `gh` command line tool, so the application stores no
  credential of its own
- Grey scale interface with semantic text colouring, all of it above the WCAG AA
  contrast threshold
